			<p><em> Bulldogs are a very much interesting type of dog that was traditionally used for the blood sports of baiting and dog fighting, 
				I find this so much more interesting but today are kept for other purposes, including companion dogs, guard dogs and catch dogs. 
				Bulldogs are typically stocky, powerful, square-built animals with large, strong, brachycephalic-type muzzles.<br> 
				"Bull" is a reference that originated in England that refers to the sport of bull baiting, which was a national sport in England between the 13th - 18th centuries. 
				It is believed bulldogs were developed during the 16th century in the Elizabethan era from the larger mastiffs, as smaller, more compact dogs were better suited for baiting.</em></p>

				The Bulldog's muscular body leads him to have a distinctive gait.
				 Because his stocky legs are set at each corner of his body, he moves with more of a waddle than a walk. 
				 It resembles sort of a loose-jointed, shuffling, sideways roll. 
				 Because their shoulders are much wider than their rear ends and they have such large heads, 
				 it's difficult for the females to whelp puppies without assistance. Most have undergone a cesarean section to deliver puppies, <br>
				 so breeding a Bulldog is an expensive proposition. They are, indeed, resolute and courageous, but they aren't out to pick a fight.
				 Unfortunately, the Bulldog's unique body and head structure make him prone to health problems.
